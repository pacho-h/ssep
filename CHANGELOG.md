## [Unreleased]

## [0.2.1] — 2026-04-28

### Changed
- All four skill descriptions strengthened with explicit "Triggers even when ..." anti-skip clauses, naming the dominant skip rationalization per skill so the description itself pushes back against it:
  - `reviewing-design-fidelity` — "even when the requested change appears trivial — single label swap, one CSS rule, one-line JSX edit"
  - `reviewing-spec-and-policy` — "even when the requirement statement reads as a single concise sentence ... concise requirements typically hide unstated questions about default values for existing data, role/permission interactions, and state-transition edge cases"
  - `improving-feature-completeness` — "even when the diff is small or the happy path was verified manually ... 'I already clicked through it in Playwright' does not substitute for the audit"
  - `running-integration-tests` — "even when only one boundary is crossed ... manual verification proves the path works once but does not produce a codified regression test"

### Added
- `CLAUDE.md` — new "Trigger discipline" section documenting four real-session skip rationalizations with their countering moves, derived from a session retrospective where all four skills should have fired but were each skipped under "task looks small" reasoning. Also notes the convention that future description edits must preserve at least one explicit "Triggers even when ..." clause per skill.

## [0.2.0] — 2026-04-27

### Added
- `reviewing-design-fidelity/references/skill-handoff.md` — explicit hand-off matrix from fidelity review to `improving-feature-completeness` (state/coverage gaps), `running-integration-tests` (BE contract drift / route bugs), and `reviewing-spec-and-policy` (design-side defects). Lists chain anti-patterns and `superpowers` composition paths.
- State coverage checklist in `reviewing-design-fidelity/references/playwright-capture.md` — explicit table covering default / empty / loading / error / hover / focus / active / disabled / long-content states with triggers and rationale; warns against synthetic-event clicks that don't update React state.
- Embedding-evidence-in-PRs section in `reviewing-design-fidelity/references/fidelity-report-template.md` — guidance on saving captures to non-temporary paths, embedding before/after pairs in the PR body, and integrating with screenshot-upload workflows. Adds a new anti-pattern entry.
- Route-matching integration-test pattern in `running-integration-tests/references/integration-test-patterns.md` — supertest example for the static-vs-dynamic-route collision case (e.g. NestJS `:itemIdx` swallowing `scope-catalog`), with the rationale that handler-unit tests cannot catch this class of bug.

### Changed
- `reviewing-design-fidelity/SKILL.md` workflow gains a Step 7 ("Hand off to the next skill") and Step 6 now links to the PR-embed guidance.

## [0.1.3] — 2026-04-17

### Changed
- Skill descriptions expanded with additional Korean trigger phrases and proactive activation hints to improve matcher recall:
  - `reviewing-design-fidelity`: added "피그마 비교해서 차이점 찾아줘", "figma vs 현재 화면", "구현이 디자인과 맞는지", "피그마대로 되어있나", "현황과 비교", "figma url 과 현재 화면 대조"
  - `reviewing-spec-and-policy`: added "이 기획대로 구현하면 빠진게 뭐가 있을까", "스펙 갭", "요구사항 누락", "기획서 애매한 부분"; clarified distinction vs `reviewing-design-fidelity`
  - `improving-feature-completeness`: added "엣지 케이스 다 챙겼나", "PR 전 점검", "빠진 상태 없나", "ship 전 검토"; added proactive trigger note for pre-PR moments on non-trivial feature branches
  - `running-integration-tests`: added "staging에서 확인", "staging 검증", "배포 후 검증", "실제 화면에서 확인", "smoke test"; added proactive trigger for deployed-feature verification and unchecked PR test-plan items

## [0.1.2] — 2026-04-17

### Fixed
- README version badge returned 404 (shields.io static badge missing color segment); replaced with dynamic GitHub tag badge that auto-syncs with released tags

### Changed
- Full name: `Super Software Engineering Power` → `Super Software Engineering Powers` across README title, `plugin.json` description, and `marketplace.json` metadata/plugin descriptions

## [0.1.1] — 2026-04-17

### Added
- Installation guide expanded: three install methods (`/plugin` UI, CLI, manual `settings.json`), explicit Update/Uninstall section, Troubleshooting table for common gotchas (cache, version, project overrides, MCP availability, autoUpdate)
- README badges (license, version, Claude Code plugin, lint status)
- Strengthened `Acknowledgments` section explicitly crediting `superpowers` (Jesse Vincent / claude-plugins-official) for design philosophy and skill anatomy
- GitHub Actions `lint.yml` workflow validating `marketplace.json`, `plugin.json`, all `SKILL.md` frontmatter (name regex, description length, body line limits, references existence), and all eval JSON files on every push and PR
- GitHub Discussions enabled for user feedback

### Changed
- README now fully English (Korean trigger phrases moved to skill descriptions only)

## [0.1.0] — 2026-04-17

Initial release.

### Added
- `reviewing-spec-and-policy` — spec/PRD/policy review from text and Figma sources
- `reviewing-design-fidelity` — implemented UI vs Figma design comparison via Playwright + Figma MCP
- `improving-feature-completeness` — production-readiness audit (states, a11y, observability, ops hooks)
- `running-integration-tests` — multi-layer test authoring with Playwright MCP
- Trigger eval sets per skill (20 queries each, 50/50 should/should-not split) for future description optimization
- Output quality eval cases per skill (`evals/evals.json`)

### Design choices vs `superpowers`
- 3rd-person skill descriptions
- `allowed-tools` declared per skill (minimum-privilege tool surface)
- Progressive disclosure: each `SKILL.md` ≤ 110 lines, deep content in `references/`
- Explicit `When NOT to use` section in every skill to define boundaries with adjacent skills (notably `superpowers:*`)

### Not yet done
- Description optimization via `skill-creator`'s `run_loop.py` — trigger eval sets are prepared; running the loop requires an Anthropic API key
- Real-world output quality validation against the eval cases
